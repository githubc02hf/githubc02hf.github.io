      <h2>Romulans</h2>
      <p>The Romulans are a humanoid species within the star trek universe which lives in the alpha quadrant. Their home planet is called Romulus. They are similar to the vulcans quite logic-based and similar to the federation looking to expand their territory. For more information go to the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulan target=_blank>Wiki-page</a>.

    <div class="column" id="q">
      <h2>"Q"</h2>
      <p>"Q" as he introduces himself is a very powerful being within the star trek universe belonging to a group of "Guardians" of that universe. These guardians are spread throughout the universe and the "Q" is assigned to the alpha quadrant, the same where the Federation of Stars is localized. 
      </p>
      <p>In the very first episode of The Next Generation is the q introduced as enemy of the Enterprise and the federation. He messes around quite childishly with the crew and captain Picard. He pops up every now and then and wants to mess with the enterprise for his own reasons, which are mainly joy and entertainment. However the organization to which he belongs decides at one point to kick him out, because he doestn take the job seriously and he thereby loses all his powers. However the enterprise helps him and he regains his powers and is int the guilt of captain Picard. He is afterwards more friendly, but still engages the Enterprise mainly for entertainment reasons or to "show" them some future enemies like the borg.
      </p>

    <div class="column" id="borg">
      <h2>Borg</h2>
      <p>The Borg is the most dangerous of all enemies of the Star Federation, because it has a unique approach to their conquering. They behave and act hivemind-like and integrate all their defeated enemies into their hive-mind. Their sole purpose is to become the only race within the universe and integrate all other races.
      </p>
      <p>Captain Picard is once abducted and integrated as well into the Borg, can however be rescued and become human again. However he ever since realizes the immense thread and potential of the Borg.
